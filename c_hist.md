## Computational histopathology

Computational histopathology represents a critical frontier in the use of AI for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, focusing on the extraction of phenotypic information from histopathology images. This field encompasses a range of tasks, including cell nuclei segmentation, tumor detection, biomarker analysis, and survival prediction, all of which play a vital role in understanding the morphological and molecular characteristics of cancer.

Our research at the AI4Health Lab primarily focuses on developing advanced deep learning models to address the significant challenges posed by the inherent limitations of histopathology data. One of the key challenges is the small size of training datasets, which can hinder the performance and generalization of AI models. To overcome this, we explore innovative techniques such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and generative models to maximize the utility of limited data.

Another major challenge is the presence of noisy and coarse ground truth annotations, which can introduce inaccuracies in model training. Our work in this area involves developing robust algorithms that can learn from imperfect data, leveraging weakly supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches to enhance model performance despite annotation quality issues.

Additionally, the high heterogeneity in histopathology data, caused by variations in staining, imaging conditions, and biological diversity, presents significant obstacles in achieving consistent and accurate predictions. Our research tackles this by designing models that are resilient to such variability, employing domain adaptation techniques and exploring the use of multi-modal data to capture a more comprehensive representation of the tissue microenvironment.

Through these efforts, we aim to advance the field of computational histopathology, enabling more accurate and reliable AI-driven tools for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Our goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and practical clinical applications, ultimately contributing to more personalized and effective cancer treatment strategies.
