## Research

### 1. [Computational histopathology](../c_hist)
Our research at the AI4Health Lab primarily focuses on developing advanced deep learning models to address the significant challenges posed by the inherent limitations of histopathology data. One of the key challenges is the small size of training datasets, which can hinder the performance and generalization of AI models. To overcome this, we explore innovative techniques such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and generative models to maximize the utility of limited data.


### 2. [Computational neuroscience](../c_neru)
Our research in computational neuroscience at the AI4Health Lab is centered on three key areas: single neuron reconstruction from light microscopy images, brain tumor and lesion segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and tractography analysis in Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Each of these areas presents unique challenges that require sophisticated, domain-inspired deep learning models tailored to address specific neurological problems.

### 3. [Computational microscopy](../c_micro)
At the AI4Health Lab, our research in computational microscopy focuses on developing innovative algorithms and models that address the challenges associated with modern microscopy techniques. Our work is particularly concentrated in three main areas: super-resolution imaging, automated image analysis, and image reconstruction from sparse or noisy data.

### 4. [Multimodal data integration](../multimodal)
At the AI4Health Lab, our research in multimodal data integration focuses on developing sophisticated algorithms and frameworks that can effectively combine and analyze heterogeneous data sources. This work is crucial for advancing personalized medicine, improving diagnostic accuracy, and uncovering new insights into disease mechanisms and treatment responses.

### 5. [Deep learning paradigms](../paradigms)
At the AI4Health Lab, our research is deeply rooted in exploring and advancing a variety of deep learning paradigms. By leveraging these paradigms, we aim to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve, particularly in the context of healthcare and biomedical research. Our work spans several key paradigms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and generative models, each offering unique capabilities and advantages for specific applications.

### 6. [Trustworthy AI for healthcare](../trustAI)
At the AI4Health Lab, our research is dedicated to advancing the principles of trustworthy AI in healthcare. We recognize that the adoption of AI in clinical settings hinges on the trust that stakeholders—ranging from healthcare providers to patients—place in these systems. Our work focuses on developing AI models that not only perform accurately but also adhere to the highest standards of ethical practice and regulatory compliance.
