Computational neuroscience is a pivotal area of research that seeks to unravel the complexities of the human brain by developing and applying computational models to understand its functionalities. By simulating and analyzing neural processes, this field provides crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive functions and the progression of neurological diseases. Through this lens, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical neuroscience and practical medical applications, advancing our understanding of the brain and its disorders.

Our research in computational neuroscience at the AI4Health Lab is centered on three key areas: single neuron reconstruction from light microscopy images, brain tumor and lesion segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and tractography analysis in Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Each of these areas presents unique challenges that require sophisticated, domain-inspired deep learning models tailored to address specific neurological problems.

## Single Neuron Reconstruction:
Reconstructing single neurons from light microscopy images is essential for understanding the structural and functional properties of individual neurons and their roles within neural circuits. Our research focuses on developing advanced algorithms that can accurately trace and reconstruct the intricate morphology of neurons from noisy and often incomplete microscopy data. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we aim to identify and preserve the fine details of neuronal structures, facilitating the study of neural connectivity and the underlying architecture of the brain.

## Brain Tumor and Lesion Segmentation in MRI:
Segmentation of brain tumors and lesions from MRI scans is critical for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of neurological diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. Our research in this domain involves designing deep learning models that can robustly and accurately segment pathological regions in the brain, despite the challenges posed by variations in tumor size, shape, and intensity, as well as the presence of imaging artifacts. By integrating domain knowledge into our models, we strive to enhance their ability to detect and delineate these regions with high precision, contributing to more effective clinical decision-making.

## Tractography Analysis in DTI:
Tractography, derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), is a powerful technique for mapping the white matter tracts in the brain, providing insights into the brain's structural connectivity. Our research focuses on developing deep learning models that can accurately analyze DTI data to identify and characterize these tracts. We aim to improve the identification of representative patterns in the complex diffusion data, which is crucial for understanding the connectivity patterns in both healthy and diseased brains. This work has significant implications for the study of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury, where changes in brain connectivity play a key role in disease progression.
