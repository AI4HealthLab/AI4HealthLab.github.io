## Computational microscopy

Computational microscopy is a transformative field that combines advanced imaging techniques with cutting-edge computational methods to enhance our ability to visualize and analyze biological specimens at unprecedented resolutions. By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, computational microscopy enables the extraction of detailed quantitative information from complex and often noisy microscopic data, providing new insights into biological processes and disease mechanisms.

At the AI4Health Lab, our research in computational microscopy focuses on developing innovative algorithms and models that address the challenges associated with modern microscopy techniques. Our work is particularly concentrated in three main areas: super-resolution imaging, automated image analysis, and image reconstruction from sparse or noisy data.

### Automated Image Analysis:
Microscopy generates vast amounts of data, which can be time-consuming and challenging to analyze manually. To address this, we are developing automated image analysis pipelines that can accurately and efficiently process large-scale microscopy datasets. These pipelines utilize machine learning algorithms to perform tasks such as cell segmentation, classification, and tracking, allowing researchers to extract meaningful biological information from complex images with minimal human intervention. By automating these processes, we enable high-throughput analysis, accelerating discoveries in fields such as developmental biology and cancer research.

### Image Reconstruction from Sparse or Noisy Data:
In many microscopy applications, data acquisition can be limited by factors such as low signal-to-noise ratio, incomplete sampling, or limited imaging time. Our research aims to overcome these limitations by developing computational methods that can reconstruct high-quality images from sparse or noisy data. By incorporating prior knowledge about the imaging system and the biological specimen into our models, we can enhance the quality of reconstructed images, revealing critical details that might otherwise be lost. This work is particularly relevant in live-cell imaging, where minimizing light exposure is essential to prevent photodamage, and in low-light imaging conditions, such as fluorescence microscopy.

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration:
Our approach to computational microscopy is highly interdisciplinary, combining expertise in AI, computer vision, and microscopy with deep biological knowledge. We collaborate closely with biologists and clinicians to ensure that our models are not only technically robust but also aligned with the needs of end-users. This collaborative approach enables us to develop tools that are directly applicable to real-world biological and medical research, ultimately contributing to advancements in healthcare and life sciences.

Through these research efforts, our goal is to push the boundaries of what is possible in microscopy, enabling scientists to explore the biological world in greater detail and with higher accuracy than ever before. The innovations we develop in computational microscopy have the potential to revolutionize how biological data is acquired, analyzed, and interpreted, leading to new discoveries and applications in fields ranging from basic research to clinical diagnostics.
